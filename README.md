# Paradise Bakers?

## PROJECT  2 :   Single Page Application Using Vue

This app is built as a one stop platform to allow homebased bakers to upload their products and share their master piece. This idea stems from the surge in homebakers during the Covid-19 pandemic period. With more sellers selling their home baked items, Baker Paradise will help to close the gap between buyers and sellers. Buyers no longer have to follow numerous instagram pages and contact sellers on by one. 



## FEATURES 
The APP plans to have the following features.

_Basic_
- A overview of all the seller listing in one page
- Contains action buttons which allows sellers to upload new items as well as edit existing listing
- Quick client site search helps buyers to quickly filter items that they are looking for via Item Name, Item Description and even search for their favourite seller (Seller Name)
- Tabluar format for the listing gives it a neat and concise overview of the item listings.
- Restful API was used, with a database personalised for the Paradise Bakers usecase. Any adding, edit and delete will call the different endpoints and update the database.


_Intermediate (coming soon...)_
- Sellers will be able to delete the items should the item is discontinued
- Allow uploading of images for each item listing


_Advance (current version will not have any development for this level)_
- Sign in button for sellers where they are only allowed to edit/delete items uploaded by them
- More form validation when creating item listings 

## UI/UX
The navigation bar is responsive for small, medium and large screens based on Bootstrap's breakpoints. 

Design was kept to a simple black and white with blue and red action buttons to clearly display the actions that sellers can take. Listings are displayed using a simple table format which gives it a clean look. 

Adding new items can be found at the top navigation panel. Upon clicking, the form displays a clear and intuitive inpur format with the use of checkboxes, drop downs, text input and radio buttons. 

The main highlight of the App is the 3 quick search inputs which helps to filter the long item listings based on the Shop Name, Item Name, Item Description. This client site serching greatly enhances the buyer's UX as they navigate their way through the plethora of listings. This greatly reduces the need for buyers to search on numerous instagram pages or websites to find the contact info of a home bakers. 

To sellers, they no longer need to fret about the cost of curating their own personal business website to showcase their talents. With the use of this one stop platform, Paradise Bakers helps them publicise and bring them closer to interested buyers. Paradise Bakers also allows sellers to see what their close competitors are doing, providing a level playing field.
